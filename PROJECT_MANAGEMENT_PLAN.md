## DECISION POINT

**YOU MUST CHOOSE NOW:**

### A) DEPLOY TO VPS NOW (RECOMMENDED)
- I provision DigitalOcean droplet
- I deploy truth_ledger.py
- Monitoring starts immediately
- Data collection begins
- **Time: 15 minutes**

### B) RUN LOCALLY 24/7
- Keep running on this sandbox
- Less reliable (sandbox can restart)
- Free (no VPS cost)
- **Time: 0 minutes** (already running)

### C) DETAILED PLANNING FIRST
- Create Gantt chart
- Define all milestones
- **Risk: Delay data collection**
- **Time: 4+ hours**

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION: A (DEPLOY NOW)

**Reason:** Every hour = 20 irreplaceable data points.  
The baseline is the asset. Start collecting NOW.

---

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

1. **IMMUTABLE LEDGER** - Can't be altered retroactively
2. **CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROOF** - SHA-256 hash chains
3. **MULTI-SOURCE VERIFICATION** - Cross-check multiple APIs
4. **FREE & OPEN SOURCE** - No vendor lock-in
5. **SELF-HOSTED** - Full control over data
6. **DISCREPANCY DETECTION** - Catch API lies automatically
7. **HISTORICAL BASELINE** - Irreplaceable time-series data
8. **ORACLE-READY** - Smart contract integration path

---

## MARKET GAPS WE FILL

1. No one offers immutable API monitoring
2. No one offers cryptographic proof of outages
3. No one offers multi-source verification
4. No one offers oracle protocol integration
5. **No one has historical baseline (WE'RE FIRST)**
